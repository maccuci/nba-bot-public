# AllStars

### Bot Description

AllStars is a Discord Bot where players can build their dream basketball team. It features a match system, leagues, card draft, formation system, among other things. This makes AllStars one of the first Discord bots of its kind, and when it officially launches, it will be even more complete.

### Version

### Technologies Used

Bot:

- **Typescript**
- **DiscordJS**

Image and Data APIs:

- **Python**
- **NBA API**
- **Pandas**

### List of Some Features to be Implemented

- [x] Create a Flow system for the best player of the losing team up until the last quarter.

- [x] When showing the lineup, have a static image of a court, but each image will be different depending on the type of marking style the player chooses. Each image should have 5 black dots, indicating where the cards will be placed.

- [x] Add shooting stats to see if it changes anything in the match action algorithm.

- [x] Review the MVP system of the match, as it might not be 100% accurate.

- [x] Fix issues when changing the team's formation or similar actions, as some cards are still remaining.

- [x] Add to the match balancing system comparisons between the stats of all cards to have a better scoring system and so on.

- [ ] Check if the points a team has are enough to move to a higher league.

- [ ] For adding the position system, have a fixed image of each type of marking with dots in each position marked as an index in the code, indicating where the card will be placed. _The only thing left to do is to implement the system to display the cards in their positions on the image._

### Examples

#### Player Card

The background and border colors change according to the rarity of the card.
